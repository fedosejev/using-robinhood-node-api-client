NodeJS Framework to make trades with the private [Robinhood](https://www.robinhood.com/) API. Using this API is not encouraged, since it's not officially available and it has been reverse engineered. See this [blog post](https://medium.com/@rohanpai25/reversing-robinhood-free-accessible-automated-stock-trading-f40fba1e7d8b) for more information on the API.

I have read [Robinhood's Terms and Conditions](https://brokerage-static.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/robinhood/legal/Robinhood%20Terms%20and%20Conditions.pdf) and, without being a lawyer and/or this being valid in any way, it doesn't seem like interacting with their servers using the API is against them.

> This framework was inspired by a deprecated Python framework originally developed by [@Rohanpai](https://github.com/rohanpai).

------------------
This framework is still in a very alpha version and will likely change, so production usage is completely discouraged.

>Even though this should be obvious: I am not affiliated in any way with Robinhood Financial LLC. I don't mean any harm or disruption in their service by providing this. Furthermore, I believe they are working on an amazing product, and hope that by publishing this NodeJS framework their users can benefit in even more ways from working with them.
